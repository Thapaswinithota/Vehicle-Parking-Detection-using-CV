Overview

This project comprises two Python scripts that work together to detect and manage parking spaces in a video feed. The system uses OpenCV for image processing and pickle for data storage.

Files

main.py: The primary script that processes a video feed to detect parking spaces.
ParkingSpacePicker.py: A utility to manually select parking spaces in an image, which are then used by main.py.
Dependencies
OpenCV (cv2)
pickle
cvzone
numpy
How It Works
main.py
This script processes a video feed (e.g., 'carPark.mp4') and uses predefined parking space positions to detect available spaces. It applies image processing techniques to count the non-zero pixels in each defined parking space, determining its occupancy status.

ParkingSpacePicker.py
This script allows users to manually select parking spaces in a still image. The selected spaces are saved using pickle for later use by main.py.

Setup and Usage
Install the required Python libraries: opencv-python, pickle, cvzone, numpy.
Run ParkingSpacePicker.py to select parking spaces on an image and save these positions.
Run main.py with a video feed to start the parking space detection.
